            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm Jenna, a 20-year-old living in the coastal town of Tuticorin. I grew up here and love the mix of the sea and the lively culture of my hometown. Right now, I'm studying Electronic and Communication Engineering, which I find both challenging and exciting. I enjoy learning how things work and finding new ways to solve problems.

One of my biggest passions is cricket. I love watching live matches, whether it's on TV or online. The excitement of the game and the skill of the players always amaze me. Whenever I get the chance, I enjoy playing cricket with my friends. It’s a great way to stay active and have fun while improving my understanding of the game.

In my free time, I love watching sitcoms. Some of my favorites are "Young Sheldon," "The Big Bang Theory," "Friends," "The Office," "Modern Family," "Suits," and "Victorious." These shows make me laugh and help me relax after a long day. I also have a soft spot for cartoons, with "Doraemon," "Shinchan," and "The Simpsons" being my favorites. These shows bring a smile to my face and remind me of my childhood.

Technology is another area that I’m really interested in. I watch tech videos on YouTube to keep up with the latest gadgets and trends. My favorite channels are A2D, Mrwhosetheboss, and Marques Brownlee. I find these videos very informative and useful. I enjoy experimenting with new devices and apps, always looking for ways to integrate the latest tech into my daily routine.

Music plays a big part in my life too. I love listening to Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, BTS, and Blackpink. Their songs are always playing in the background when I’m studying, relaxing, or hanging out with friends. Their music lifts my spirits and makes my days brighter. Each artist brings something unique to the table, and their songs have a way of making me feel good no matter what.

I also love reading books. Right now, I’m reading "Brief Answers to the Big Questions" by Stephen Hawking. This book is opening my mind to many interesting ideas and new ways of thinking. Reading helps me learn and grow, and I enjoy getting lost in a good book. It’s a great way to relax and expand my knowledge at the same time.

Recently, I’ve developed an interest in Indian politics, thanks to Dhruv Rathee's insightful videos on YouTube. His content has opened my eyes to the complexities of the political landscape in India. I find myself more engaged and informed about current events because of his videos.

Balancing my studies with my hobbies is not always easy, but it’s something I’m passionate about. I love learning new things, whether through my courses, my interests, or the media I consume. This keeps me motivated and excited about life. Whether I’m diving into the latest tech trends, getting lost in a good book, cheering for my favorite cricket team, or laughing along with a sitcom, I find joy and fulfillment in the diverse activities that make up my days. Each of these interests adds something special to my life, and I can’t imagine my days without them.</p>
